# Machine Learning Prediction Projects

This repository contains two machine learning prediction applications built with Flask. Each application predicts different outcomes based on user input data.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Iris Flower Prediction
This application predicts the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal dimensions.
